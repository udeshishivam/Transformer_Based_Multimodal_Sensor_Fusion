# WeatherNet

## What is it?
This is three convolutional neural networks, trained to classify weather (sunny, foggy, rainy, snowy, cloudy or other). First one based on AlexNet architecture, the second one - LeNet, and the third one - ZfNet. Files with code, training results and plots you can find in folders with the name of architecture you are interested in.

## How to use?
- First of all, you need to download requirements (all the libraries which is imported in code)
- Next, download trained models using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRaLC2dLkKFTV_GvwW93lr8B5HU0fJ_O?usp=sharing ("Qualifier" is for AlexNet, another models contain first letter of architecture name)
- Go to "Commands.txt" file to realise how to classify your image
